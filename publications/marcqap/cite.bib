                    Answering (CQA) reports a single main result on a common CQA benchmark. While
                    existing models show impressive results on CQA leaderboards, it remains unclear
                    whether they are robust to shifts in setting (sometimes to more realistic ones),
                    training data size (e.g., from large to small sets) and domain. In this work, we
                    design and conduct the first large-scale robustness study of history modeling
                    approaches for CQA. We find that high benchmark scores do not necessarily
                    translate to strong robustness, and that various methods can perform extremely
                    differently under different settings. Equipped with the insights from our study,
                    we design a novel prompt-based history modeling approach and demonstrate its
                    strong robustness across various settings. Our approach is inspired by existing
                    methods that highlight historic answers in the passage. However, instead of
                    highlighting by modifying the passage token embeddings, we add textual prompts
                    directly in the passage text. Our approach is simple, easy to plug into
                    practically any model, and highly effective, thus we recommend it as a starting
                    point for future model developers. We also hope that our study and insights will
                    raise awareness to the importance of robustness-focused evaluation, in addition
                    to obtaining high leaderboard scores, leading to better CQA systems.1}",
